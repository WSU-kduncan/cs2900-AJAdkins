For this project i will be using the container technologies of Podman and Docker

1. Investigate available mounts
	Docker - docker has two mount types volumes and bind mounts
		To use mounts with docker the command 
			docker run 
		is used followed by several options, the type of mount, the source of the mount
		and the destination as well as the ability to decide permissions. 
	Podman - supports bind, volume, image, tmpfs, and devpts
		In podman you can mount a filesystem with a command 
			podman run --mount, type=, source
		the types can be any of the listed above and the source shows the path to what
		is going to be mounted, there are several different flags and options that can 
		go with the mounts such as granting permissions with -ro and -rw

2. Investigate building images for the container engine
	Docker - Docker has its own build support which can build images from a Dockerfile or from specifiv
		files
			docker build 
			docker image build
		Docker build is command used to build an image along with several options such as -f which 
		names the new dockerfile, the path can be specific files on the host system or a URL for a 
		directory online. 
	Podman - Podman also has its own build support which can build an image from a specific directory
		or from a Dockerfile.
			podman build -f [imagefile]
			podman image build 
		there are lots of different options with these commands, the image can be built from
		a directory with -f
