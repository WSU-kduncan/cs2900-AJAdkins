1. Docker - has three networking modes, host which uses the host's networking directly, bridge which is the default
	mode which connects the containers allowing them to communicate with eachother but not others that are on 
	the outside of that network, and none which disables the networking all together
	To start a host network you use the docker run --network host --name [] 
	To make it have no networking its the same thing except after --network none
	Using a bridge network requires first to make one with dokcer network create [network name] you can speficy options 
		then when you docker run --network [name of created bridged network] which connects the containers to the 
		new network

   Podman - bridge, which works the same as the other bridge networks, host which also uses the hosts networking, Macvlan
	which gives the container a physical network interface on the host and Slirp4netns which is the default mode
	which connects the containter to the usermode TCP/IP stack
	all of these networking options are run on a the container startup with podman run --network [network mode]
	Macvlan and Bridge networks still need to be made with podman network create before the container can connect
	to those types of modes

2. I found one call dockerfilelint which analyzes a dokcerfile and looks for common traps, mistakes and helps enforce best
	practices. It searches a lot of different things, just choosing a few from the long list, Base image should specify a tag,
	avoid running  "apt-get updgrade" or "apt-get dist-upgrade", implement checking (similar to ADD), formats volumes
		this lint is on github replicatedhq/dockerfilelint

	I found a scanner named Clair, it scans for all vulnerablities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures which 
	is a public list of disclosed computer security flaws
	It has vulnerablilties in that the flaws must be in the CVE list and some only happen under certain conditions
