Container Technologies
	Buildah
	Podman

How to install
	I installed both of mine on an Ubuntu system in a VM inside VirtualBox, in the last project is switched my connection from NAT to Internal Network
	so I had a 10 minute period of scratching my head until i realized I needed to switch the connection back to NAT...duh. So that would be step one for
	both installs.
	-Buildah
	to install Buildah on an Ubuntu system, first i updated everything with "sudo apt-get update"
	then becasue Buildah is part of the Ubuntu official repository "sudo apt-get install buildah" installs buildah onto the system
	--Podman
	podman is installed in the same way "sudo apt-get install podman"

Pulling a container image
-Buildah
	to pull an image you use a command "from" - I used "buildah from centos"
	then to view whatever images you have the command "buildah images" and to see running containers "buildah containers" is used
buildah also allows you to build your own image


Running a container

Iniatilizing differs from running a container in that each process much complete successfully or else it wont start the next one
to run a container and enter the shell "podman start [container name]" worked for me the container name was registry.centos.org/centos
to run the same container in detached mode podman supports the flag "-d" which then runs it in detached mode, it basically runs in the background

Logs & Status
podman logs displays all the logs for whichever container you specify
a useful command i found to display status was podman pod ps which can dispaly useful information

Stopping a container
Podman provides all of these commands "podman pause/unpause" "podman start" etc. podman -h will provide the help menus showing all that it does.
